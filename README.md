# UselessPDE.jl

*There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge. -Bertrand Russell*

The objective of this project is using julia to create a package which applies useless numerical schemes to solve useless PDEs by useless programming techniques. After all, the project is useless.

## Useless numerical schemes

Outdated naive numerical schemes, like Laxâ€“Friedrichs method.

## Useless PDEs

One dimensional time-dependent PDEs, like one-dimensional linear hyperbolic PDEs.

## Useless programming techniques

Some functional programming skills. To be specified.
